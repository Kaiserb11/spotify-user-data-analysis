# ABOUT
I have used 3 different machine learning classification techniques and applied them on a user data to predict whether the person would like it or not.

# MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES USED 
- KNN (K nearest neighbour)
- SVM (Support vector machine)
- Decision tree

# dataset
- [Spotify user data](https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification)
(already included in the repo as <b>spotify.csv</b>)
 
# REQUIREMENTS 
- Sk learn (pip install sklearn)
- numpy (pip install numpy)
- pickle (pip install pickle-mixin)
- pandas (pip install pandas)

# CONCLUSION
<b>This projet is an outcome of curosity and is not aiming towards efficiency.</b> I made this project to see what these classificaiton alogs are capable of. The predicted outcomes as observed were not very accurate. One of the prime reasons being the user concentric nature of the dataset.
